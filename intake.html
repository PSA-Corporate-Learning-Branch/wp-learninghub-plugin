            <h1>What Gets Included in the Learning<strong>HUB</strong>?</h1>
            <p>Learning<strong>HUB</strong> courses are formal learning opportunities that are available
                to all BC Public employees, no matter what ministry you're in, or what level you are.
            </p>
            <p>As a BCPS employee, you will find all the courses within available and open for
                registration. Courses that are no longer offered are regularily removed from the 
                catalog.
            </p>

                <summary>Is the course formal learning?</summary>
                <p>Formal Learning is a composed set of resources designed to meet an end-goal,
                    generally facilitated and evaluated in some way, resulting in a verifiable 
                    credit via an institution or organization.
                </p>
                <p>The Learning<strong>HUB</strong> catalog is a collaborative effort between numerous
                    learning Partners, with representatives from each partner responsible for the courses 
                    listed under their banner.

                <summary>Is the course informal learning?</summary>
                <p>Informal learning are resources which may be invaluable by themselves, 
                    but your consumption of the content is not tracked or verifiable by an 
                    institution or organization as part of a structured approach to
                    a particular topic.</p>
                <p>By themselves, informal learning opportunities cannot be included 
                    into the LearningHUB without additional structure and context,
                    hopefully adding to an existing formal experience, or by creating 
                    an entirely new one.
