    <summary>It's Informal Learning</summary>
    <p>Informal learning are resources which may be invaluable by themselves, 
        but your consumption of the content is not tracked by an 
        institution or organization as part of a structured approach to
        a particular topic.</p>
    <p>By themselves, informal learning opportunities cannot be included 
        into the LearningHUB without adding some structure and context,
        hopefully adding to an existing formal experience, or by creating 
        an entirely new one.

        <summary>Can the course be formalized?</summary>
        <p><a href="#">Learning Curator</a> Pathways offer a great avenue to 
            add formalization to disparate resources. Check out the available 
            pathways to see where this content might fit best!

        <summary>The course cannot be formalized</summary>
        <p>All hope is not lost! <a href="">an appeal to the HUB committee</a>
            could yield an opportunity for the resource to be included in 
            our weekly blog post featuring the best of what's out there.
